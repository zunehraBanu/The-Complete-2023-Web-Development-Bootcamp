/*Notes: Attributes are pieces of information or properties associated with HTML elements that provide additional details about the elements. Examples include the "src" attribute in an image tag specifying the image source or the "class" attribute defining the CSS class of an element. In JavaScript, the setAttribute method is used to dynamically set the value of an attribute for a given HTML element. It takes two parameters: the name of the attribute and the value to be set. Conversely, the getAttribute method retrieves the value of a specified attribute from an element. Both methods facilitate dynamic manipulation of attributes, allowing developers to modify or retrieve attribute values during runtime, contributing to the flexibility and interactivity of web applications. */
