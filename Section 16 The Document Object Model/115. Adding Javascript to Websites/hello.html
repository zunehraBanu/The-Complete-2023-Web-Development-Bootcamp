<!--Inline JavaScript refers to the practice of writing JavaScript code directly within the HTML file, within HTML event attributes. The code is embedded directly into the HTML document and is executed when the browser encounters it during parsing.  On the line itself-->

<!--Internal JavaScript, also known as embedded JavaScript, involves placing the JavaScript code within the <script> tags in the <head> or <body> section of the HTML document. The JavaScript code is part of the HTML file but is separated from the HTML content.-->

<!--External JavaScript involves placing the JavaScript code in a separate external file with a .js extension. This file is then linked to the HTML document using the <script> tag's src attribute.-->
