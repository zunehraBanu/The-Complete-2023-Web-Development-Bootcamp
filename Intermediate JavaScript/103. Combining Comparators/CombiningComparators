/*this code generates a random love score between 1 and 100, then displays a personalized message based on the calculated love score. If the love score is 70 or higher and provides different messages based on the range in which the love score falls. The messages vary from expressing a high level of love to suggesting a less compatible match.*/

/*The "and" operator (&&) in JavaScript combines two Boolean conditions in a way that the overall expression is true only if both individual conditions are true. It is commonly used in conditional statements to require that multiple criteria must be satisfied simultaneously for the associated block of code to be executed. In my below code, the && operator is employed to check if the loveScore is both greater than 30 and less than 70 before displaying a specific message.*/

prompt("What is your name: ");  //This line prompts the user to enter their name. The entered value is not stored or used explicitly in the code.

prompt("What is their name: "); //This line prompts the user to enter the name of the person they are interested in or want to check their love score with. Similarly, the entered value is not stored or used explicitly in the code.

var loveScore=Math.random()*100; //This line generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), multiplies it by 100, resulting in a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive). This value is assigned to the variable loveScore.

loveScore=Math.floor(loveScore)+1;//This line rounds down the loveScore value to the nearest integer using Math.floor(), and then adds 1. This ensures that the final value of loveScore is an integer between 1 and 100 (both inclusive).


//The conditional statement checks the value of loveScore:
if(loveScore>=70){   
    alert("Your love score is: " + loveScore + "% You love each other a lot.");
} else if(loveScore>30 && loveScore<70){
    alert("Your love score is: " + loveScore + "%");
}
 else{
    alert("Your love score is: " + loveScore + "% you go together like oil and water");
}

//Explanation of Conditional statements: 
/*The if statement begins with the keyword if followed by a condition inside parentheses. In this case, the condition is loveScore >= 70. This condition checks if the value of loveScore is greater than or equal to 70.

If the condition is true, the code block inside the curly braces {} immediately after the if statement is executed. In this case, it displays an alert message indicating a high love score: "Your love score is: " + loveScore + "% You love each other a lot."

If the condition is false, the code block inside the else statement is executed. The else statement provides an alternative set of instructions to be carried out when the initial condition is not met. In this case, it displays a different alert message: "Your love score is: " + loveScore + "%"*/
